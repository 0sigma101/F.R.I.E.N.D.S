   Our target is to build a solution that will serve as an platform for one and all where animals will be taken care of without any drawbacks.
   We focus on creating a connection between all the necessary departments related to animal welfare starting from Rescue centers, Veterinary Clinics , 
   Adoption Centres to professional Training coaches as well. Our solution also gives good priority to pet lovers. We provide a community platform for pet 
   owners to connect and share their views to an open sector.Pet owners also have the feature to track their buddies via our app which provides live tracking of pets.
